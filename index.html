	we propose an efficient two-stage architecture which makes full use of the complementarity of two subtasks to achieve robust localization and 
  high-quality proposals generation of the target jointly. 
  The proposed tracker runs at over 30 FPS and sets a new state-of-the-art on five challenging tracking benchmarks.
